 * ChaosBall - GameCritic
 * 
 * 1. I created a timer to see how long it takes for all the chaos balls to reach their goals. 
 * 
 * 2. I added a terrain around the border filled with trees and grass to make it look nice around the environment.
 *      - also changed the directional light to make the scene look good as well.
 *      
 * 3. I tried to add new variations to the chaos balls, some big and some small, with different bounciness levels.
 * 
 * 4. I lastly added a "Play Again" button to make sure it replays the game, and the timer that is also created.
 *    - (It was kinda difficult to get the button to click, so when you click it, make sure to press the spacebar key, that should work!)
