/* Improving The Game 
 * 
 * 1. Is the game too easy or hard? 
 *    - The game is too easy to be honest, with how I positioned each of the chaos balls, they're easily able to reach their goals.
 * 
 * 2. What would make it easier or harder?
 *    - I would make it a bit harder, because the game is too easy.
 *    
 * 3. What would give it a "wow" factor?
 *    - I think customizing the stage even more to make it look more fun and engaging.
 *    
 * 4. What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
 *    - What makes some parts of the game fun is chaos balls being able to reach their specific goals. 
 *      What's tedious about it is the certain balls taking a bit longer to reach the goal.
