 * Particle Effect Modifications
 * 
 * - Cube 
 *     - The color of the cube is teal, I wanted to give this my all onto this one. I was very interested in seeing
 *       what I could possibly do with this to make it my own! With the particles spawning around the object, and it
 *       looks like it is leveling up! 
 *       
 *   1. Duration - 3.0
 *   2. Start Lifetime - 3.0 
 *   3. Start Speed - 2.4 
 *   4. Simulation Speed - 1.15 
 *   5. Emission 
 *      - Rate Over Time = 5
 *      - Rate Over Distance = 0
 *      
 * - Cylinder 
 *      - I modified the particle system to the cylinder to make it look similar to the video from the assignment.
 *        I tried to make it look pretty nice, and to make sure that particles match the color of the object! 
 *    
 *   1. Duration - 6.15
 *   2. Start Lifetime - 1.0
 *   3. Start Speed - 3
 *   4. Simulation Speed - 1.93
 *   5. Emission
 *      - Rate Over Time = 25
 *      - Rate Over Distance = 5
 *   6. Color by Speed
 *   7. Color over Lifetime
 *   8. Collision
 *
