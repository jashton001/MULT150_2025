/* UserInterface.cs Description
 * 
 * Throughout the project, I made a few changes from the exercise to make it look presentable.
 * 
 * - I added a picture of a the beach with a nice, transparent blu-ish color in the background.
 * 
 * - I tried to change the text of the description of the sub-heading text, the description is a random message, I 
 *   created to make it funny at least.
 *   
 * - I changed the colors of the text for the headings, so it doesn't look basic!
 * 
 * - The button has also been customized as well, the normal color is much of a teal color. When you hover over it, it's a blue color,
 *   then when you click it, it turns green! Once you click the button, it says "Loading...".
